### CPSC 120

*Lab 6 part 1

I liked this lab because it was all about sandwiches which I love but more importantly used strings. Iâ€™ve struggled with strings and this lab helped me with mastering them.

*Lab 5 Part 2

I liked this lab because it was the first one to really challenge me. This lab used both integers and doubles which I was not accustomed to at the beginning. It also showed me how to use static_cast. 

*Lab 7 Part 1

This lab was the hardest for me which made it my favorite lab. The process of taking the days and using mathematical equations in order to calculate it into the calendar we used for the project was hard to figure out but extremely rewarding.
